        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This pineapple curry is sweet and spicy. After trying this amazing dish at my neighbourhood Thai restaurant, I decided to recreate it at home.</p>
        <p>My version of the curry is completely vegan. I loosely followed <em>Hot Thai Kitchen's</em> Pineapple Curry Recipe 
            <a href="https://hot-thai-kitchen.com/pineapple-curry/#tasty-recipes-8368-jump-target">(link here)</a>
             and substituted in vegan ingredients. </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 can pineapples packed in juice</li>
                <li>4-5 Tbsp red curry paste</li>
                <li>1 1/2 cups coconut milk</li>
                <li>1/2 cup water or veggie stock (unsalted)</li>
                <li>7-8 makrut lime leaves or zest of 2 limes</li>
                <li>1-2 Tbsp vegan fish sauce or maggi seasoning</li>
                <li>2-3 tsp chopped palm sugar or brown sugar</li>
                <li>1 Tbsp tamarind paste</li>
                <li>your choice of veggies and protein</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Add 1.2 cup of coconut milk to a medium pot over medium heat to boil. Add red curry paste. Reduce heat and continue to cook, stirring frequently. Continue stirring until the paste is thick and the coconut oil has started separating from the paste. </li>
                <li>Add the rest of the coconut milk, pineapple chunks, and water or stock. Add lime leaves or lime zest. Simmer on medium low heat for ~5min.</li>
                <li>Add vegan fish sauce or maggi seasoning, tarmarind paste, and sugar to taste. You can add a little of the pineapple juice as well.</li>
                <li>Add in vegetables and protein and cook for one minute. Remove from heat.</li>
                <li>Taste and adjust final seasoning. Enjoy!</li>
            </ol>
